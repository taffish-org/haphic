  Command    Description
  --------   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  pipeline   Execute an automated pipeline consisting of "cluster", "reassign",
             "sort", and "build". For better result through parameter tuning
             or to parallelize the "sort" step on a computer cluster, you may
             run the commands below individually:

  cluster    [Step1] Execute preprocessing and Markov clustering for contigs.
  reassign   [Step2] Reassign and rescue contigs. Perform additional agglomerative
                     hierarchical clustering if necessary.
  sort       [Step3] Order and orient contigs within each group.
  build      [Step4] Build final scaffolds (pseudomolecules).

  plot       Draw Hi-C contact map for the whole genome or each scaffold.
  check      Check whether all dependencies are correctly installed.
  refsort    Order and orient whole scaffolds based on a reference genome.

  allhic     Call a modified version of ALLHiC, in which the hot-start optimization
             has been fixed (source code: https://github.com/zengxiaofei/allhic).
  juicer     Show the guide to generate files for Juicebox visualization.
